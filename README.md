# DNA to Protein and RNA Sequence Converter

This project provides a web application to convert DNA sequences to protein and RNA sequences using Django and BioPython.

## Features

- Convert DNA sequence to RNA sequence.
- Convert DNA sequence to protein sequence.
- User-friendly web interface to input DNA sequences.
- Validation of DNA sequences.

## Technologies Used

- Django: For the web framework.
- BioPython: For biological sequence conversion.
- HTML/CSS: For the frontend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x
- BioPython

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/Brijesh-103/Biopython_Dna_Converter.git
    cd Biopython_Dna_Converter
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

### Running the Application

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Usage

1. Enter your DNA sequence in the provided text box.
2. Click on "Convert to RNA" to get the RNA sequence.
3. Click on "Convert to Protein" to get the protein sequence.

### File Structure

- `DNASequence/`: Django project folder.
- `dna/`: Django app folder containing the main application.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web pages.
